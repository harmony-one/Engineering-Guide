1. Closing GitHub Issues:

- Issues that have been resolved or fixed should be closed promptly.
- When closing an issue, provide a clear explanation or reference to the resolution.
- Encourage users to reopen the issue if the problem reoccurs or if there are further questions.
- Routine Cleanup:
- Go through issues that are 90 days old or older
- Check if problem is solved elsewhere
- Add some notes about why the issue is being solved and tag approporiately (such as duplicate)
- If the author of the issue has been contacted for information and did not respond, make a note and close the issue

2. Handling Stale Pull Requests (PRs):

- Regularly review open PRs to identify stale ones without any activity.
- Consider the following timeline for handling stale PRs:
- After 30 days of inactivity: Add a comment politely requesting an update from the contributor. Mention that the PR will be closed if no response is received within a specific timeframe.
- After 60 days of inactivity: If no response or activity is seen, add another comment stating that the PR will be closed in a given period, usually 7-14 days.
- After the designated timeframe: Close the PR with a comment stating it is being closed due to inactivity. Encourage contributors to reopen the PR if they wish to continue working on it.

3. Communication and Transparency:

- Communicate the closing of issues and PRs to maintain transparency.
- Consider using issue or PR templates to guide contributors on the expected information and steps for resolution.
- Encourage users to contact other communication channels (e.g., community forums, mailing lists) for further discussions if their issues or PRs are closed.
